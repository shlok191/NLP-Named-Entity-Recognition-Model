# Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Bi-LSTM

## Overview

This project implements Named Entity Recognition (NER) using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) neural network. The goal is to identify and classify entities such as persons, organizations, and locations in a given text dataset!

## Introduction

Named Entity Recognition is a natural language processing task that involves identifying and classifying named entities in text. In this project, we leverage a Bi-LSTM model, a type of recurrent neural network, to perform NER on a given dataset.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shlok191/NLP-Named-Entity-Recognition-Model
   cd NLP-Named-Entity-Recognition-Model
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
2. Utilize python3 to run the main.py file
